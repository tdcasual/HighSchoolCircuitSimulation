## Gate Summary

| Gate | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Code health (`npm run check`) | PASS | 全量 lint/format/test 通过（仅保留 1 条既有 warning） |
| Electrical baseline (`npm run baseline:p0`) | PASS | `output/baselines/p0-electrical-current.json` |
| Mobile responsive flow (`npm run test:e2e:responsive`) | PASS | `output/e2e/responsive-touch/mobile-flow-baseline.json` |
| Observation stress regression | PASS | `output/benchmarks/observation-stress/observation-stress-regression.md` |
| AI teaching mini-eval | PASS | `output/benchmarks/ai-teaching-mini-eval/mini-eval.md` |
| Interaction guide sync | PASS | `docs/process/component-interaction-usage-guide.md` + CI `check:interaction-guide` |

## Required Commands

```bash
npm run check
npm run baseline:p0
npm run test:e2e:responsive
node scripts/benchmark/observation-stress-regression.mjs
node scripts/benchmark/ai-teaching-mini-eval.mjs
```

## Release Decision

- Decision: `GO`
- Constraints:
  - Keep monitoring the known lint warning in `src/ui/ai/PanelLayoutController.js:125`.
  - Continue enforcing interaction-guide sync for any input behavior change.
