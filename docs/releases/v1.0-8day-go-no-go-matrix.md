# v1.0 8-Day Go/No-Go Matrix

Date: 2026-04-06

## Matrix

| Dimension | Go Condition | Current State | Result |
|---|---|---|---|
| Solver correctness | P0 electrical baseline no diff regression | `scenarios=20` passed | GO |
| Architecture hardening | Day 2/3/4 decoupling slices landed with tests | Runtime diagnostics + registry + netlist DTO path completed | GO |
| Mobile KPI validity | Synthetic / behavior tiers split and validated | `tests/mobileFlowMetrics.validity.spec.js` passed | GO |
| Observation performance | Large-sample linked cursor lookup bounded | Stress test + benchmark passed | GO |
| AI teaching reliability | Canonical categories + partial context have稳定 what/why/how | Reliability tests + mini-eval passed | GO |
| Release documentation | Readiness gate + closure review + interaction guide revision linked | 文档完整且可追踪 | GO |

## Blocking Rules

- Any row marked `NO-GO` blocks release.
- Baseline diffs or missing closure evidence require rollback to previous green commit.
- Interaction behavior changes without guide update are treated as `NO-GO`.

## Outcome

All dimensions satisfy `GO` conditions for the 8-day sprint closure.
