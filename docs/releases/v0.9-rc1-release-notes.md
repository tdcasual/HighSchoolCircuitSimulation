# v0.9 RC1 Release Notes

Date: 2026-03-27
Status: Release Candidate

## Highlights

- Mobile-first interaction flow completed (wire snapping tolerance, anti-mistouch, one-hand quick actions, responsive touch edit/measure).
- Observation workflow upgraded (preset/template, linked cursor, auto-range stabilization, PNG export).
- Classroom package added with 6 scenario presets for teaching demos.
- First-run guidance added with optional remember-dismiss behavior.
- AI tutoring now maps runtime diagnostics to actionable lesson prompts:
  - what happened,
  - why it happened,
  - how to fix it.

## Changelog (Since v0.8 baseline)

1. Reliability and diagnostics
- Added structured runtime failure categories and hints.
- Added invalid-topology guard rails and clearer short-circuit reporting.

2. Mobile UX
- Reduced accidental operations in touch mode.
- Improved wire endpoint snapping behavior and touch consistency.

3. Observation system
- Added template save/load and quick bind behavior.
- Added linked crosshair and stabilized chart range behavior.
- Added chart export action and metadata stamping.

4. Classroom readiness
- Added classroom scenario pack with schema/runtime validation tests.
- Added first-run guide for onboarding in classroom usage.

5. AI guidance
- Added error-to-lesson mapping in local knowledge provider.
- Propagated runtime diagnostics into AI knowledge retrieval context.

6. Packaging and release hardening
- Embed packaging now tolerates missing optional `examples/` directory.
- Full quality gate (`check:full`) passes with baseline comparisons.

## Migration Notes

- Existing observation payloads remain backward compatible and are normalized at load time.
- Internal import path changed for classroom scenarios:
  - from `src/core/scenarios/ClassroomScenarioPack.js`
  - to `src/engine/scenarios/ClassroomScenarioPack.js`
- Embed build scripts no longer require `examples/` to exist.

## Known Issues

| ID | Severity | Issue | Scope | Workaround |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| KI-001 | Low | ESLint reports one warning in `scripts/e2e/wire-interaction-regression.mjs` (`args` unused) | Dev tooling | Rename to `_args` or remove unused arg in next cleanup day |
| KI-002 | Low | Node warning about `--localstorage-file` path appears in some test runs | Local test logs | Non-blocking; ignore during CI/local verification |
| KI-003 | Low | Embedded package omits `assets/examples` when source directory is absent | Embed docs/examples bundle | Add repository `examples/` folder before packaging if demo assets are needed |

## Verification Snapshot

- `npm run check:full` -> pass
- Includes:
  - `npm run check`
  - `npm run baseline:p0`
  - `npm run baseline:circuitjs`
  - `npm run baseline:ai`
