# PR Description Template - Post-v0.9 8-Day Sprint

## Title

`<type>: <short summary>`

## Background

- This PR is part of the post-v0.9 8-day hardening sprint.
- Goal: improve architecture reliability, release gate integrity, and teaching stability without solver behavior regression.

## Scope

### Included

1. `<item 1>`
2. `<item 2>`
3. `<item 3>`

### Excluded

- `<explicitly out-of-scope item 1>`
- `<explicitly out-of-scope item 2>`

## Key Changes

1. Code:
   - `<file path>`: `<what changed>`
   - `<file path>`: `<what changed>`
2. Tests:
   - `<test path>`: `<what behavior is covered>`
3. Docs:
   - `<doc path>`: `<what evidence/spec was added>`

## Risk Assessment

- Primary risk: `<risk>`
- Mitigation:
  - `<mitigation 1>`
  - `<mitigation 2>`
- Regression surface:
  - `<affected runtime path>`
  - `<affected UI path>`

## Validation

Executed:

```bash
npm test -- <focused test set>
npm run baseline:p0
npm run check
```

Result:

- Focused tests: `PASS`
- Baseline diff: `PASS`
- Full gate: `PASS` (known non-blocking warnings can be listed below)

## Known Non-Blocking Warnings

- `src/ui/ai/PanelLayoutController.js:125` unused arg warning (existing issue).

## Artifacts / Evidence

- `<artifact path 1>`
- `<artifact path 2>`
- `<artifact path 3>`

## Rollback Plan

1. Revert PR commit range.
2. Re-run `npm run check` + `npm run baseline:p0`.
3. Confirm artifact index and release gate docs remain coherent.

## Checklist

- [ ] Requirement coverage matches plan/spec.
- [ ] No undocumented interaction behavior changes.
- [ ] CI gates updated if new release/documentation obligations were introduced.
- [ ] Focused + baseline + full checks executed.
